# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

This project demonstrates capturing and analyzing live network traffic using Wireshark. We learned how to capture packets on an active network interface, identify common protocols like DNS, ARP, and TLS, and understand their roles in network communication. This hands-on exercise enhanced our practical skills in packet capture, filtering, and protocol analysis.
