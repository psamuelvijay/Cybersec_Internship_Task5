Network Traffic Capture Report
Capture Date: October 2, 2025
Capture Duration: Approximately 1 minute
Network Interface: Wi-Fi
Total Packets Captured: 50 (approximate)

Protocols Identified and Summary
DNS (Domain Name System)

Number of packets: 28

DNS handles domain name resolution, translating website names into IP addresses. DNS queries were triggered during web browsing.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

Number of packets: 2

ARP resolves MAC addresses corresponding to IP addresses on the local network, facilitating communication within the LAN.

TLS (Transport Layer Security)

Number of packets: 20

TLS ensures encrypted communication between client and server, seen in HTTPS traffic during web browsing, securing data transmission.

Packet Analysis Details
Traffic was generated via ICMP ping requests and web browsing (HTTPS websites).

DNS packets show domain lookups needed to access websites like Wikipedia.

ARP packets handled local network MAC address resolution.

TLS packets represent encrypted HTTPS traffic, confirming secure browsing.

No unencrypted HTTP packets were visibly captured, as modern websites use HTTPS by default.

File Name: network_capture.pcap

This capture represents basic network communication protocols observed on a live network interface during typical internet browsing and ping operations.
